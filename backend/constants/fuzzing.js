      description: `The mission consists of creating DeWork, a decentralized application (dApp) for freelancing services with a backend in Golang and frontend in Next.js.
    The blockchain component of the project involves the development of smart contracts for:
    Freelancing - agreements between project owners and freelancers.
    Escrow - a court of freelancers to adjudicate disputes, with random arbitrator selection.
    Launchpad - crowdfunding platform for projects with funds restricted to freelance contract use.
    Monetized content (pubs) - users can sell scripts, SaaS, templates, etc., with royalty deductions.
    Challenges - companies post challenges, freelancers attempt solutions, and arbitrators award up to 3 winners from a prize pool.
    ERC20 Governance Token - create a governance token based on the ERC20 protocol including the governance system and tokenomics.
    ERC721URIStorage - use ERC721URIStorage protocol to store non-essential blockchain data off-chain to reduce gas costs.
